# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform CEIA's Microsoft Forms travel request system into a custom web application with database persistence
- Maintain familiar user experience while eliminating current form limitations
- Enable dynamic field controls and conditional logic within the form flow
- Persist all form submissions in a PostgreSQL database for future reference
- Provide administrative dashboard for viewing and managing travel requests
- Create foundation for future enhancements including API integrations and approval workflows

### Background Context

CEIA currently relies on Microsoft Forms for processing travel and per diem requests, which has created significant operational limitations including lack of database persistence, inability to implement dynamic fields, and no integrated flight search capabilities. This custom web application will replicate the exact functionality of the existing 8-page form while addressing these limitations through a Next.js-based solution with PostgreSQL storage. The MVP focuses on creating a "Simple Clone+" that maintains user familiarity while establishing a technical foundation for future enhancements including dynamic data integration, approval workflows, and third-party API connections.
