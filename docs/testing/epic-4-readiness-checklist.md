PUT    /api/admin/trips/:id      // Update trip status
DELETE /api/admin/trips/:id      // Cancel/delete trip

GET    /api/admin/users          // List all users
GET    /api/admin/users/:id      // Get user details
PUT    /api/admin/users/:id      // Update user info

GET    /api/admin/stats          // Dashboard statistics

```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Required tables/columns for dashboard
ALTER TABLE trip_requests ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE trip_requests ADD COLUMN reviewed_by UUID;
ALTER TABLE trip_requests ADD COLUMN reviewed_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE trip_requests ADD COLUMN notes TEXT;

CREATE TABLE admin_actions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    admin_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    action_type VARCHAR(50),
    target_type VARCHAR(50),
    target_id UUID,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_trip_status ON trip_requests(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_trip_created ON trip_requests(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_admin_actions ON admin_actions(admin_id, created_at);
