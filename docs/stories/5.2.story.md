# Story 5.2: Authentication and Storage Configuration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure cloud authentication providers and storage buckets,
**So that** users can authenticate and upload files to the cloud instance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Verify email/password authentication is enabled in cloud project
2. Configure OAuth providers (note: requires external credentials):
   - Google OAuth (provide setup instructions if credentials not available)
   - Microsoft OAuth (provide setup instructions if credentials not available)
3. Create "travel-documents" storage bucket with settings:
   - Public: false (private)
   - File size limit: 10MB
   - Allowed MIME types: jpg, png, pdf, doc, docx
4. Configure storage RLS policies:
   - Users can upload/read their own files (user_id folder structure)
   - Admins can access all files
5. Test bucket creation and permission setup
6. Document OAuth setup steps for manual completion (if credentials not immediately available)

## Notes
- OAuth provider configuration may require external credentials from Google Cloud Console and Azure AD
- If OAuth credentials are not immediately available, provide clear setup documentation for later configuration
- Storage RLS policies follow user_id folder structure: `<user-id>/passport.jpg`
- Admin access to all files requires profiles table with role column (already created in Story 5.1)
- File size limit of 10MB matches PRD requirements
- MIME type restrictions align with passport images (jpg, png) and flight suggestions (pdf, doc, docx)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Completion Notes
- **Authentication Configuration**: Email/password auth verified enabled by default, no configuration needed
- **OAuth Provider Documentation**: Comprehensive setup guides created for both Google and Microsoft OAuth
  - Google OAuth: 4-step process with troubleshooting (3 common errors documented)
  - Microsoft OAuth: 6-step process with Azure AD integration (4 common errors documented)
  - Both providers pending external credential configuration (requires Google Cloud Console and Azure AD access)
- **Storage Bucket**: "travel-documents" bucket created successfully via SQL
  - Public: false (private - requires authentication)
  - File size limit: 10MB (10,485,760 bytes)
  - MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, application/pdf, application/msword, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document
- **Storage RLS Policies**: All 5 policies documented for manual dashboard configuration
  - Automated SQL creation blocked by permission constraints (expected for Supabase Cloud)
  - Complete SQL provided in setup guide for dashboard application
  - Policies cover: user folder upload, read, update, delete + admin full access
- **Testing Status**: Bucket configuration verified; full file upload/download testing requires RLS policies to be applied via dashboard first
- **Documentation**: Complete setup guide created at docs/supabase-oauth-setup.md with:
  - Authentication configuration status
  - Step-by-step OAuth setup for Google and Microsoft
  - Storage bucket and RLS policy configuration instructions
  - Testing examples and troubleshooting sections

### File List
**Created:**
- `docs/supabase-oauth-setup.md` (comprehensive authentication and storage configuration guide)

**Modified:**
- `docs/stories/5.2.story.md` (status update, all checkboxes marked, Dev Agent Record added)

**Cloud Infrastructure Changes:**
- Created storage bucket `travel-documents` in Supabase Cloud project swsncutfzczgubdzjcpk
  - Bucket ID: travel-documents
  - Configuration verified via SQL query

### Change Log
1. Verified email/password authentication enabled (default Supabase configuration)
2. Researched Supabase authentication and storage documentation via MCP
3. Created comprehensive OAuth setup guide for Google and Microsoft providers
4. Created "travel-documents" storage bucket via SQL with all required settings:
   - Private bucket (public: false)
   - 10MB file size limit
   - 5 MIME types configured (jpeg, png, pdf, doc, docx)
5. Documented 5 storage RLS policies for manual dashboard setup (automated creation blocked by permissions)
6. Verified bucket creation and configuration via SQL queries
7. Created comprehensive setup documentation file
8. Updated story file with all completion details and Dev Agent Record

### Debug Log References
- Storage RLS policy creation attempt blocked by permissions (expected behavior for Supabase Cloud security)
- SQL error 42501: "must be owner of table objects" → Documented policies for manual dashboard setup instead
- All other operations completed successfully on first attempt

### Post-Implementation Verification (2025-10-19)
**Verified By**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
**Verification Method**: SQL queries via Supabase MCP Server + User confirmation

**Results:**
- ✅ Storage bucket `travel-documents` verified operational
- ✅ 8 RLS policies verified active (4 user + 4 admin policies)
- ✅ All policy logic verified correct (bucket_id, folder structure, admin role checks)
- ✅ Google OAuth configuration confirmed (dashboard-level, user verified)
- ✅ Microsoft/Azure OAuth configuration confirmed (dashboard-level, user verified)
- ✅ Email/password authentication verified enabled

**SQL Verification Queries Executed:**
1. `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'storage' AND tablename = 'objects'` → 8 policies found
2. `SELECT rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'storage' AND tablename = 'objects'` → RLS enabled
3. `SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'travel-documents'` → Bucket configuration verified
4. `SELECT * FROM auth.sso_providers` → Empty (OAuth configured at project level, not queryable)
5. `SELECT * FROM auth.identities` → Empty (no users yet, ready for authentication)

### Manual Steps Required
**High Priority** (Required for full functionality):
1. ✅ **Storage RLS Policies**: ~~Apply 5 policies via Supabase Dashboard~~ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ All 8 policies verified active (4 user policies + 4 admin policies)
   - ✅ Policies correctly target travel-documents bucket
   - ✅ User folder structure enforced: `<user-id>/filename`
   - ✅ Admin access to all files verified via profiles.role check

**Medium Priority** (Optional OAuth providers):
2. ✅ **Google OAuth**: ~~Configure via Google Cloud Console and Supabase Dashboard~~ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Google OAuth configured via dashboard
   - ✅ Client ID and Client Secret configured
   - ✅ Redirect URI: `https://swsncutfzczgubdzjcpk.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

  - Users can read own files (SELECT)
  - Users can update own files (UPDATE)
  - Users can delete own files (DELETE)
  - Admins can access all files (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ✅ All policies correctly check bucket_id = 'travel-documents'
- ✅ User policies enforce folder structure: `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text`
- ✅ Admin policies verify: `profiles.role = 'admin'`

**Authentication Status:**
- ✅ Email/password authentication enabled (default)
- ✅ Google OAuth configured (verified via dashboard by user)
- ✅ Microsoft/Azure OAuth configured (verified via dashboard by user)
- ℹ️ Note: OAuth provider settings stored at project level, not queryable via SQL

### Testing Recommendations
Ready for end-to-end testing after Story 5.3 (environment configuration):
1. Create test user via email/password
2. Test Google OAuth sign-in flow
3. Test Microsoft OAuth sign-in flow
4. Upload test image to verify user folder structure
5. Verify user can only access own files
6. Test admin access with admin role user
7. Verify MIME type restrictions (try uploading non-allowed file type)
8. Verify file size limit (try uploading >10MB file)
