# Story 2.1: Form Layout and Navigation Framework

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to navigate through a multi-step form with clear progress indication,
**So that** I understand where I am in the submission process.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Form layout component with fixed background image applied to all pages
2. Progress indicator showing current page (1 of 8) with step names in Portuguese
3. Navigation buttons "Anterior" (Previous) and "Próximo" (Next) styled with shadcn/ui
4. Zustand store created with form state structure for all fields
5. Navigation logic preventing forward movement without required fields
6. Browser back/forward button support maintaining form state
7. Breadcrumb navigation allowing jump to previously completed pages

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Authentication is fully implemented using Supabase with @supabase/ssr package (migrated from deprecated auth-helpers)
- OAuth providers require manual configuration in Supabase Studio
- Protected routes pattern established in apps/web/src/app/(protected)/layout.tsx

### File Locations
Based on the project structure, new files should be created at:
- Form components: `apps/web/src/components/form/`
- Stores: `apps/web/src/stores/`
- Hooks: Create new directory `apps/web/src/hooks/`
- Tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/`
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Component Architecture
The form will use a single-page application pattern with dynamic content switching:
- Main form page at `apps/web/src/app/(protected)/form/page.tsx`
- Form layout wrapper handles state machine and navigation
- Individual page components in `apps/web/src/components/form/pages/`
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]

### State Management Details
Use Zustand with persist middleware for form state:
```typescript
interface FormState {
  formData: Partial<TravelRequestInput>;
  currentPage: number;
  visitedPages: number[];
  updateFormData: (data: Partial<TravelRequestInput>) => void;
  setCurrentPage: (page: number) => void;
  markPageVisited: (page: number) => void;
}
```
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

### UI Component Library
All UI components must use shadcn/ui components:
- Button component from `@/components/ui/button`
- Form components from `@/components/ui/form`
- Use TailwindCSS for styling with utility classes
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Form Data Model
The form data structure must match the TravelRequest interface:
- Pages 1-8 correspond to different sections of the TravelRequest model
- Conditional fields for international travel, time restrictions, and flight preferences
- All date fields use Date type, strings for text inputs
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#travelrequest]

### Navigation Flow
The form uses conditional navigation based on user selections:
- Page 5 (International) only shows if destination is international
- Page 6 (Time Restrictions) only shows if user indicates constraints
- Page 7 (Flight Preferences) only shows if user wants to suggest flights
[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-core-form-flow-data-capture.md#story-24]

### Validation Requirements
- All required fields must be validated before allowing navigation
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Display Portuguese error messages for all validation failures
- CPF field requires mask: 000.000.000-00
- Phone field requires appropriate Brazilian phone mask
[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-core-form-flow-data-capture.md#story-22]

### Testing
- Test files location: `apps/web/tests/unit/`
- Use Vitest for unit testing (version 1.0+)
- Follow testing patterns from architecture/testing-strategy.md
- Mock Zustand stores using zustand/middleware patterns
- Test component rendering with @testing-library/react
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
